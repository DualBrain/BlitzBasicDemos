Blitz Basic tutorial for Amiten TV

Part 1: Hello World - A simple "Hello World" program

Part 2: Copper List - This is a little more indepth, covering the creation of a Copper List and setting up a Display with DisplayLibrary in AGA mode.

Part 3: Control - Similar to previous part, but now you can use the joystick to scroll endlessly.

Part 4: Blitter - Basic blitter demonstration. Change the #BLITKIND constant near the top to 0,1,2 to see the different kinds of blitter command in action.

Bart 5: Dual playfield - More advanced demonstration of the Dual Playfield mode, running in AGA with 8 Bitplanes. Again try changing the #BLITKIND constant to see how the blitter command now affects the graphic display.
