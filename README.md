# Sprite Multiplexing demo
A rudimentary (and not exactly finished) Sprite Multiplexing demo. Compared to the built in Blitz "CustomSprites" option, it:
- Offers virtually limitless sprites, rather than just an additional 8 (still limited to no more than 8 per scanline)
- Doesn't need a point where there's a clean break between top and bottom sprites - sprites can be staggered.

It's pretty rough though - it only supports attached (16 colour) sprites and doesn't fully support all Sprite features (high resolution positioning etc). I only really made this for a very bespoke purpose, but it should be enough to help you get started on your own multiplexing solution if you need something a bit more powerful than what Blitz offers built in.
